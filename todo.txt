chunksize - for better multiprocessing


filter outliers  - at least X tokens for it to be a legal sentence
#1 - look at functions at the left end of the corener-are they the similar language? sanity check
add code to get function number!
#2 - same per cluster!+inspect if logically in same cluster
in dendorgram 0-three zeros in the middle-look at their code
cluster number1-are 0's (logically)clustered?

redefine definition of secrity threat
prior distribution of data
get function from 4 differrent datasets and try to cluster and see results are random(e..g not all from same datasets in the same cluster-sanity check)

#5 train on all clusters vs separate ones
which classifier to use-doesn't really matter at this stage, #5 is more important
naive based works fine and is explianalable, but code has less entropy, so might not work. for future-think about which model will work with code embedding
